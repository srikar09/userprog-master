# How to make a copy of this starter repo:

0. Obtain [private repos](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack/) for free 
1. Go to Github and create a private repo:
   - Don't do anything fancy yet (i.e. don't initialize the repo with a readme, don't add a .gitignore, etc)
   - Just give it a name, make sure to choose "private," and then click "create repository"
2. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/justintemp/Pintos_Starter.git`
3. Cd into the folder you just cloned `cd Pintos_Starter`
4. Change the .git folder with `rm -rf .git`
5. Create a blank .git folder with `git init`
5. Change the remote repo to point to your own git repo. First go to your repo and find the `git remote add origin` command. Copy that line and then run it
6. Add all the code with `git add .`
7. Commit the code `git commit -m "initial commit"`
8. Push the code to your remote repo and set the upstream `git push --set-upstream origin master`

# How to install pintos

0. Make sure that the dependencies have been installed:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get install qemu`
   - `sudo apt-get install realpath`
1. Run this command: `source install.sh`
2. If that doesn't work, read the error messages.

# How to run all of the pintos tests

0. Go into the directory for the current project (for the first pintos project, this will be the userprog directory): `cd userprog`
1. Build the directory with `make`
2. Run `make check`:
   - You'll see a lot of stuff being output, but if you're patient for about 10-30 minutes, you'll get a summary of your results at the end.

# How to run a single pintos test

With the help of Dr. Google, I was able to write a convenient script for you all.

0. Open up the `run_pintos_tests.sh` file in the `userprog` directory and change it to use the tests that you want to run
1. Simply add to (or remove from) the list of test files you see in the `TEST_FILES` variable
2. The list of all the tests can be seen by running `ls build/tests/userprog` (all of the green executables in here are test files)

Things to note
   - You can redirect anything you don't care about to /dev/null
   - The script redirects the result of the test to /dev/null and prints the output of the test by default. You can easily change this by changing the file redirection

# How to debug a pintos test with GDB

This is rather cumbersome, so just bear with me.

First run `make check` and then kill it with Ctrl-c after you get some output that looks like this:

```
cd build && make check
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/justin/Github/Pintos_Labs/userprog/build'
pintos -v -k -T 60 --qemu  --filesys-size=2 -p tests/userprog/args-none -a args-none -- -q  -f run args-none < /dev/null 2> tests/userprog/args-none.errors > tests/userprog/args-none.output
perl -I../.. ../../tests/userprog/args-none.ck tests/userprog/args-none tests/userprog/args-none.result
fail tests/userprog/args-none
```

There are three things for each test that gets run:

(1)
`pintos -v -k -T 60 --qemu  --filesys-size=2 -p tests/userprog/args-none -a args-none -- -q  -f run args-none < /dev/null 2> tests/userprog/args-none.errors > tests/userprog/args-none.output`

(2)
`perl -I../.. ../../tests/userprog/args-none.ck tests/userprog/args-none tests/userprog/args-none.result`

(3)
`fail tests/userprog/args-none`

You really only care about the first one. Copy the entire command except for everything after the `< /dev/null` part since that is just used to redirect output and error messages (look familiar?)

Paste what you just copied onto the command line. 
   - Don't press enter yet
   - Edit the beginning of the command to say `pintos --gdb` instead of just `pintos`
   - Make sure the path is right (i.e. change the `tests/userprog/args-none` to have build/ in front of it: `build/tests/userprog/args-none`
   - Now you can hit enter

You'll notice that the output is paused. This is because the pintos process you just ran is waiting for you to attach your GDB debugger. 

Open up a new terminal tab with the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-t
   - Run the script to attach your GDB debugger to the running pintos process: `./attachGdb.sh`
   - The script launches gdb with the `--tui` flag by default (you can remove this if you'd like)
   - The first command you should always run is `debugpintos` (nothing will work without running this)
   - Then you're all set
